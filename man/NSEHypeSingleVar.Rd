\title{Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency}
\usage{
NSEHypeSingleVar(sim, obs, na.rm = TRUE, progbar = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim}{\code{\link{HypeSingleVar}} array with simulated variable (one or several iterations).}

\item{obs}{\code{\link{HypeSingleVar}} array with observed variable, (one iteration). If several iterations are present 
in the array, only the first will be used.}

\item{progbar}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} progress bars will be printed for main computational steps.}

\item{...}{ignored}
}
\value{
A two-dimensional array with NSE for all time series pairs provided in \code{sim} and \code{obs}, with values in the same order 
as the second and third dimension in \code{sim}, i.e. \code{[subid, iteration]}.
}
\description{
Nash-sutcliffe Efficiency calculation for imported HYPE outputs with single variables for several catchments, i.e. time and 
map files, optionally multiple model run iterations combined.
